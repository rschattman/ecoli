Environmental factors that affect e. coli survivorship in vegetable cropping systems

By identifying environmental factors that vegetable producers can observe and monitor, stakeholders in the U.S. vegetable industry can better identify periods within a growing season when there may be a relatively high level of risk for crop contamination by fecal-borne pathogens. These findings can be used in the future to inform quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) such as those described by Danyluk and Schaffner (2011), and to estimate the potential impact that climate change will have on environmental factors and, by extension, microbial contamination in agronomic systems (Boxall et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2015). In addition, farmers can use individual or collections of environmental indicators to better understand the relative risk they face, depending on their ability to invest time and financial resources in monitoring for specific conditions. 
To address these issues, we tracked local (data logger) and regional (weather station) data and integrated it with E. coli populations recorded from soil and vegetative matter (in spinach). This project compares several strucutural equation models to determine which environmental factors tell vegetable producers the most amount of information about potential microbial contamination of their crops. Models factors were selected based on realistic modes through which farmers would recieve environmental information.
